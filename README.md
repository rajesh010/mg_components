# mg_components

### Welcome to **mg_components** 🎉  
A personal library I’m building for myself, but hey, if you find it useful, good for you! MIT license, baby! Do whatever you want with it.  

---

### 🚀 **The Plans**  
I’m creating this to make my life easier (because who else is going to do it, right?). But maybe—just maybe—you'll find it useful too. The goal is to build a library that serves me **and** possibly you in the long run. I’ve got some big plans for the future, so stay tuned for more "shits" to come.  

- **Start Simple**: Begin with the basics like buttons, cards, inputs, etc. Then, slowly add highly customized components as I explore new ideas and workflows.  
- **Modularity is Key**: Everything’s designed to be customizable and easy to theme, so I don’t have to sweat the small stuff. Focus on the bigger problems, right?  
- **Real-time Playground**: I’m building a playground where you can tweak components in real-time and see the changes live. The best part? Copy-paste code directly from there. No design system, just *play*.  

But hey, I’ll try my best to stick to standard event names and conventions? But then again… it’s me, so **be thankful already**. 🙃

### 🧠 **By Default**:  
- **Clean & Simple UI**: Expect a clean, modular, no-nonsense UI to begin with.  
- **Futuristic Sci-Fi UI**: Eventually, I’ll branch off into something **out of this world**. Think glowing buttons, floating cards, and all the sci-fi vibes you never knew you needed. But for now... life’s a mess, and I need time to breathe.  

---

### ✨ **Key Features**  
- **Modular Components**: Easily customizable and extendable components. Because flexibility is the **key to happiness** (and minimal code rework, let’s be honest).  
- **Live Playground**: Tweak and test everything in real-time with a live preview. Customize your components and copy the code you need to keep moving.  
- **Clean & Simple Layout**: Straightforward at first, but **stay tuned** for the *sci-fi madness* when I get to it.  
- **Branching Out**: Keep an eye on other branches. Who knows? In a few years, things will get pretty interesting. 👀

### 💡 **Usage**  
**Disclaimer**: This is primarily for me, but hey, if you're not allergic to chaotic, constantly-evolving libraries, feel free to join in. I’ll try to make it standard and easy to use, but **no promises**. It's a work-in-progress, and I can't be held responsible for anything that breaks along the way.  

---

### 📜 **License**  
MIT License — Because you do you, and I’ll do me. No judgments, just code.  

---

### 🛠️ **Let’s Build**  
Now, let's get back to building awesome things and pretending we have it all together in this crazy world, shall we?

---

### 🙋‍♂️ ** (If You Care)**  
***mg*** I’m **Mohan Gautam** (aka **mg**). By the way, **mg** is also a shortcut for **Muji**, which loosely translates to *“asshole”* in Nepali. So, yeah, enjoy the ride and be prepared for some chaos.  

---

> 💬 **P.S.**: Remember, this library is built to make life easier—one chaotic line of code at a time. Stay tuned, and let's see where this goes. 😎
